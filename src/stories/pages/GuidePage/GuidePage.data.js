The category of “mobile units” includes:</p><ul><li>Motor vehicles,</li><li>Trailers,</li><li>Pushcarts, bikes, or kiosks, and</li><li>Peddlers on foot selling from coolers or hot boxes.</li></ul><p>A mobile food vendor may work inside the region listed on the mobile food vending permit. Regions include the City of Austin, rural Travis County, or local cities and towns contracted with Austin Public Health.</p><p>The mobile food vending permit does not replace the base fixed food permit. All mobile food vendors must have a Central Preparation Facility (CPF), which is a fixed food business that provides services to the mobile food unit.</p><h2>Unrestricted and restricted permits</h2><p>The type of permit you need depends on the food-handling method you’ll be using.</p><h3>Unrestricted permits</h3><p>Unrestricted permits are for vendors handling open food, drinks, or both inside the mobile unit. Examples include snow cones, BBQ, any cooking of foods, and staff-handled drinks.</p><h3>Restricted permits</h3><p>Restricted permits are for vendors handling only pre-wrapped food, drinks, or both that must be stored hot, cold, or with time control to keep from spoiling. No open food work is allowed, and all food, drinks, and toppings must be pre-packaged or wrapped at a permitted food business. Examples include packaged frozen foods, grab-and-go tacos, and self-serve drink urns.</p><h3>City of Austin or Travis County</h3><p>City of Austin mobile food ordinances only apply inside Austin city limits. However, this includes local cities and towns that have contracted with the City of Austin so that vendors can use the same permit. Those cities and towns are:</p><ul><li>Bee Cave,</li><li>Lakeway,</li><li>Manor,</li><li>Rollingwood,</li><li>Sunset Valley,</li><li>Volente, and</li><li>Westlake Hills.</li></ul><p>Travis County follows the <a href=\"https://dshs.texas.gov/foodestablishments/laws-rules.aspx\">Texas Food Establishment Rules</a> and <a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/HS/htm/HS.341.htm\">Chapter 341 of the Texas Health and Safety code</a>.</p><h2>Fees</h2><h3>City of Austin</h3><p>This includes municipalities contracted with the City of Austin (see list above).</p><p><code>|Type of fee | Cost |<br/>|----------- | ---------- |<br/> | Mobile vendor application fee | $105 |<br/> | Unrestricted permit (per unit) | $290 |<br/>| Restricted permit (per unit) | $212 |<br/> | Mobile vendor re-inspection | $130 |<br/> | Mobile vendor Austin Fire Department inspection* | $204 |<br/> | Mobile vendor Austin Fire Department re-inspection* | The first is free, then $204 per re-inspection |<br/>| Food manager certificate registration | $31 |<br/> | Food manager certificate replacement | $16 |<br/> | Central preparation facility registration (non-refundable) | $150 |</code></p><p>*These fees are assessed by Austin Fire Department.</p><h3>Travis County</h3><p><code>| Type of fee | Cost |<br/> |--------- | ---------- |<br/>| Unrestricted (per unit) | $273 |<br/> | Restricted (per unit) | $198 |<br/> | Mobile vendor fire inspection | $125 |<br/> | Central preparation facility registration | No fee |</code></p>",
