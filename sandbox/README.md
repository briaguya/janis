This is a sandbox environment used to test react stuff in isolation.

I made it because it's a little easier than making a brand new create-react-app for a simple test.

Copy and paste this sandbox into a non code-committed directory to test new React/CSS features locally.

Run it with `webpack-dev-server` inside this directory.
